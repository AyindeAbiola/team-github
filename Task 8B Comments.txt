Task 8B (Environment Variable)

GET Request
1. Find pet by ID:
I was able to set a Enviroment variable manually and automatedly

2. Find pets by status:
I was unable to declare variables because the Values kept changing par execution, and for us to declare a variable either global or environment wise, values must maintain stability.

3. Find pets by tags
I couldn't fetch pets' data by tags because the response body is empty. Hence, I couldn't parse variable.
